# Drum-kit

Welcome to the my Drum Kit project! ðŸŽµ  
This project is a creative web application designed to simulate a virtual drum kit, allowing users to make music through key presses or button clicks. It showcases fundamental frontend JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and audio integration, wrapped up in a fun and interactive experience.

- **Understand Interactivity:** Build an application where user input (via keyboard and mouse) drives functionality.
- **Learn Through Creativity:** Combine programming with playful experimentation for a deeper understanding of how web applications work.
